# Kaggle Playground S3E7

This repo is for my submissions to the Kaggle competition [*Playground Series - Season 3, Episode 7*](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e7/data).

## Project Structure
All of the dependencies are stored in `ENV.yml` and can be installed with `conda env create -n ENVNAME --file ENV.yml`.

The three data files are stored in the `/data` directory.
